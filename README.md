| id | user_id | friend_id |
| --- |:-------:| -----:|
| 1 | 10 | 1000 |
| 2 | 1000 | 1100 |
| 3 | 1100 | 1200 |
| 4 | 11 | 1300 |
| 5 | 12 | 1400 |
| 6 | 13 | 1500 |
| 7 | 14 | 10 |

What should I do when friend A with user_id 10 has no friend record of user_id 14. 
But user_id 14 has record of friend_id 10. There is also possibility of duplication.
